Online Multiplayer Chess Game

# How To: Multiplayer
You will need to get your IPv4 Address if you want to host an online game, if you're joining someone, you will need their IPv4 Address. This is how to get your IP address:
* On Windows:
    1. Open Settings
    2. Wi-Fi
    3. Go to your Network Name Properties
    4. Scroll Down to IPv4 Address

Note: I completely understand the worry of using sharing your IP, you might be skeptical about me Logging it, and you really should be, I would do the same if I were in your place, but the entire project is open-source under this repository to make sure everyone feels safe using this.
